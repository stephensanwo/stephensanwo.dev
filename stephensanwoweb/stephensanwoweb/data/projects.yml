      title: Open Workflow
      description: Open Workflow is an open source low-code analytics automation workflow, that decouples monolithic analytics projects into re-usable functional components that can be chained together to solve a problem. Open Workflow improves the collaboration between business process owners (who are typically non-coders), and developers, by providing an infrastructure where developers can share pre-written functions, targeted at solving specific use cases, which consumers can then mix and match while building their workflows using a simple user interface
