      title: Hyper - AI Knowledge Bot (Alpha)
      description: Hyper is an AI enabled knowledge bot, that uses GPT4 to power knowledge queries, with the aim of tackling information overload. GPT4 is trained on mostly historical data, and does not have the context of your everyday documents like lecture notes, legal contracts etc. With Hyper, you can add this missing context to GPT4 by providing it with your data and documents then ask questions right within chat interfaces you are already familiar with.

      title: Open Workflow
      description: Open Workflow is an open source low-code analytics automation workflow, that decouples monolithic analytics projects into re-usable functional components that can be chained together to solve a problem. Open Workflow improves the collaboration between business process owners (who are typically non-coders), and developers, by providing an infrastructure where developers can share pre-written functions, targeted at solving specific use cases, which consumers can then mix and match while building their workflows using a simple user interface
